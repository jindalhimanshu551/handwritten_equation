This is an equation solver which takes as input handwritten text, and outputs the answer for the equation.

# Step 1: Download the data

Dataset can be downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xainano/handwrittenmathsymbols

Place the symbol folders you would like to train in a folder named data

For this implementation, we used 0-9, +, -, times, =

# Step 2: Generate the equations

Run *equation_generator.ipynb*

# Step 3: Train the neural network and export the model

Run *train_classifier.ipynb*

# Step 4: Host the model online via TensorFlow Serving

(to be added)
